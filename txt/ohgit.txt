Did something terribly wrong -- magic time machine!
    'git reflog'
  # find the index HEAD@{index} before you broke everything
    'git reset HEAD@{index}'

Committed and realized I need to make one small change!
  # make your change
    'git add . # or add individual files'
    'git commit --amend --no-edit'
  # now your last commit contains that change!
  # WARNING: never amend public commits

Need to change the message on my last commit!
    'git commit --amend'
  # follow prompts to change the commit message

Committed something to master that should have been on a new branch
  # create a new branch from the current state of master
    'git branch some-new-branch-name'
  # remove the last commit from the master branch
    'git reset HEAD~ --hard'
    'git checkout some-new-branch-name'
  # your commit lives in this branch now :)

Accidentally comitted to the wrong branch!
  # undo the last commit, but leave the changes available
    'git reset HEAD~ --soft'
    'git stash'
  # move to the correct branch
    'git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch'
    'git stash pop'
    'git add . # or add individual files'
    'git commit -m "your message here";'
  # now your changes are on the correct branch

    OR

    'git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch'
  # grab the last commit to master
    'git cherry-pick master'
  # delete it from master
    'git checkout master'
    'git reset HEAD~ --hard'

Tried to run a diff, but nothing happened?!
    'git diff --staged'

Need to undo a commit from like 5 commits ago!
    'git log'
  # once you've found your commit, save the hash
    'git revert [saved hash]'
  # follow prompts to edit the commit message
  # or just save and commit

Need to undo my changes to a file!
    'git log'
  # once you've found your commit, save the hash
    'git checkout [saved hash] -- path/to/file'
  # the old version of the file will be in your index
    'git commit -m "Wow, you don't have to copy-paste to undo"'

Everything is borked! Nuke it from orbit!
  # get the lastest state of origin
    'git fetch origin'
    'git checkout master'
    'git reset --hard origin/master'
  # delete untracked files and directories
    'git clean -d --force'
  # repeat checkout/reset/clean for each borked branch
